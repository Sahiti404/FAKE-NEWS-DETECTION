This project uses  machine learning algorithms to label news articles as either "Fake" or "True" depending on their content. Employing a mix of Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods and a Logistic Regression classifier, the model is trained on a labeled dataset of news articles. It utilizes TF-IDF for feature extraction and Chi-Square feature selection to improve model performance. . The project is designed to help combat misinformation by offering an automated solution for fake news detection.
